The goal of this project is to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the exposure notification API from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/). The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **verification service** for the Corona-Warn-App. This implementation is still a **work in progress**, and the code it contains is currently alpha-quality code.

## Architecture Overview
You can find an architectural overview of the component in the [solution architecture document](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/solution_architecture.md)  
This component of the Corona-warn-app whereas named **verification process** provides indeed two functionalities:  
1. prove that a pretended positive case is indeed positive  
2. provide the result of a Covid-19 Test  

To achieve this, the verification service gets the result of covid-19 tests from LIS (**L**abor **I**nformation **S**ystem) which deliver test results to it. The complete process is described in [cwa-documentation/Solution Architecture](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/solution_architecture.md) to which you may refer for detailed information about the workflow.

The software stack of the verification server is based on spring boot, currently with an in-memory H2 database. As the persistence relies on the liquibase.


## Development

This component can be locally build in order to test the functionality of the interfaces and verify the concepts it is build upon.  
There are two ways to build:
 - [Maven](https:///maven.apache.org) build - to run this component as spring application on your local machine
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com) build - to run it as docker container build from the provided docker build [file](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-verification-server/blob/master/Dockerfile)
 ### Prerequisites
 [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net)  
 [Maven](https://apache.maven.org)  
 *(optional)*: [Docker](https://www.docker.com)  
 ### Build
 Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

 In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described afterwards depending on the way you choose.
#### Maven based build
For actively take part on the development this is the way you should choose.   
Please check, whether following prerequisites are fulfilled
- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) or a similar JDK 11 compatible VM  
- [Maven](https://apache.maven.org)  

is installed on your machine.  
You can then open a terminal pointing to the root directory of the verification server and do the following:

    mvn package
    java -jar target/cwa-verification-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  

The verification server will start up and run locally on your machine available on port 8080.

#### Docker based build  
We recommend that you first check the prerequisites to ensure that  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)  

is installed on you machine  

On the commandline do the following:
```bash
docker build -f|--file <path to dockerfile>  -t <imagename>  <path-to-verificationserver-root>
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it <imagename>
```
or simply  
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t cwa-verificationserver "."
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it cwa-verificationserver
```
if you are in the root of the checked out repository.  
The docker image will then run on your local machine on port 8080 assuming you configured docker for shared network mode.
#### API Documentation  

Along with the application there comes a swagger2 api documentation which you can access in your web browser, when the verification server applications runs:

    <base-url>/swagger-ui.html#/verification-controller

mostly like:  

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/verification-controller



#### Remarks
This repository contains files which support our CI/CD pipeline and will be removed without further notice  
 - DockerfileCi - used for the GitHub build chain
 - Jenkinsfile - used for Telekom internal SBS (**S**oftware**B**uild**S**ervice)
