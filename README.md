The goal of this project is to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the exposure notification API from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/). The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **verification service** for the Corona-Warn-App. This implementation is still a **work in progress**, and the code it contains is currently alpha-quality code.

## About this component

In the world of the Corona Warn App the Verification Server helps validating whether upload requests from the mobile App are valid or not. The parts of the verification component cooperate in the following manner:

- The Verification Server of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-server) helps validating whether upload requests from the mobile App are valid or not.
- The Verification Portal of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-portal) allows hotline employees to generate teleTANs which are used by users of the mobile App to upload their diagnostic keys.
- The Verification Identity and Access of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-verification-iam) ensures that only authorized health personnel get access to the Verification Portal.
- The Test Result Server of the Corona Warn App (repository: cwa-testresult-server) receives the results from laboratories and delivers these results to the app via the verification-server.

## Architecture overview
You can find an architectural overview of the component in the [solution architecture document](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/solution_architecture.md).  
This component of the Corona-Warn-App whereas named **verification process** provides indeed two functionalities:  
1. prove that a pretended positive case is indeed positive  
2. provide the result of a COVID-19 test  

To achieve this, the verification service gets the result of COVID-19 tests from LIS (**L**abor **I**nformation **S**ystem) which delivers test results to it. The complete process is described in [cwa-documentation/Solution Architecture](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/solution_architecture.md) to which you may refer for detailed information about the workflow.

The software stack of the verification server is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), currently with an in-memory H2 database. As the persistence relies on [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org).

## Development
This component can be locally build in order to test the functionality of the interfaces and verify the concepts it is built upon.  

There are two ways to build:
 - [Maven](https:///maven.apache.org) build - to run this component as spring application on your local machine
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com) build - to run it as docker container build from the provided docker build [file](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-verification-server/blob/master/Dockerfile)

### Prerequisites
 - [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net)  
 - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
 - *(optional)*: [Docker](https://www.docker.com)  

### Build
Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described afterwards depending on the way you choose.

#### Maven based build
This is the recommmended way for taking part in the development.  
Please check, whether following prerequisites are installed on your machine:
- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) or a similar JDK 11 compatible VM  
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

You can then open a terminal pointing to the root directory of the verification server and do the following:

    mvn package
    java -jar target/cwa-verification-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  

The verification server will start up and run locally on your machine available on port 8080.

#### Docker based build  
We recommend that you first check to ensure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed on your machine.

On the command line do the following:
```bash
docker build -f|--file <path to dockerfile>  -t <imagename>  <path-to-verificationserver-root>
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it <imagename>
```
or simply  
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t cwa-verificationserver "."
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp -it cwa-verificationserver
```
if you are in the root of the checked out repository.  
The docker image will then run on your local machine on port 8080 assuming you configured docker for shared network mode.

#### API documentation  
Along with the application there comes a [swagger2](https://swagger.io) API documentation, which you can access in your web browser when the verification server applications runs:

    <base-url>/swagger-ui.html#/verification-controller

Which results in the following URL on your local machine:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/verification-controller

#### Remarks
This repository contains files which support our CI/CD pipeline and will be removed without further notice  
 - DockerfileCi - used for the GitHub build chain
 - Jenkinsfile - used for Telekom internal SBS (**S**oftware**B**uild**S**ervice)
