# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Corona-Warn-App is built with security and data privacy in mind to ensure your data is safe. We are grateful for security researchers and users reporting a vulnerability to us, first. To ensure that your request is handled in a timely manner and non-disclosure of vulnerabilities can be assured, please follow the below guideline.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities directly on GitHub. GitHub Issues can be publicly seen and therefore would result in a direct disclosure.**

* Please address questions about data privacy, security concepts, and other media requests to the cert@telekom.de mailbox.
